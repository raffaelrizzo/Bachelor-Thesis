# Bachelor-Thesis - Is it possible to automatically measure technical skills in football by developing a computer vision app?
The aim of my bachelor thesis was to develop an application in Python that uses computer vision and machine learning to automatically evaluate ball juggling in football. 
By proving the feasibility of the application, I was able to answer the research question with "yes".
The application has met with a very good response. The long term goal is to add more exercises and make them accessible to the general public.
